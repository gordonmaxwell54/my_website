	<h1>Playstation 3</h1>
		<p>The Playstation 3 is the third console in the Playstation series of consoles that are made by Sony. It is the first Playstation to include HDMI display and it uses Blu-Ray discs for its games. It can also play Blu-Ray movies as well.</p>

		<p>The Playstation 3 is also the first Playstation console to introduce a HUB menu known as the XMB screen which gives the user access to a load of different things that the console can provide like loading both disc games and digitally downloaded games, the internet and a variety of different video streaming apps.</p>

		<p>Sony wanted to make their own version of the Wii Remote for the Playstation 3 so they made the Playstation Move. It was released in 17th Sepember 2010 and only a few games implemented the Move which meant that it was not as popular than any other motion sensor controllers.</p>

	<h1>XBOX 360</h1>
		<p>The XBOX 360 is the second console in the XBOX series of consoles that are made by Microsoft. Similar to the Playstation 3, the XBOX 360 has a home screen that allow the player to access all of the things that the console has to offer.</p>

		<p>However, the XBOX 360 allows the user to create an online persona that can be used in a variety of game for the console. This added a sense of imursion into the games that were released for the console as it felt like you were in the game.</p>

		<p>Microsoft also made their version of a motion sensor controller but it is a lot more unique than the Wii or PS3's. It is called the Kinect and it is like a larger verison of the Wii Sensor Bar and the PS Move camera. However, you don't hold a controller. You become the controller! You move your body to control characters in the game and there is a game where you just relax and play with animals called 'Kinect Animals'. It did not perform as well as people believe but it still managed to get a lot of games for this peripheral </p>

	<h1>Nintendo Wii</h1>
		<p>The Nintendo Wii console was the first console to feature motion controls that were implemented into nearly every game that was released for the console. It was made by Nintendo and released on 19th November 2006 which means it is nearly 10 years old.</p>

		<p>The Nintendo Wii had a number of peripherals to use such as the Nunchuk, Classic Controller, GameCube Controller, Wii Balance Board and more. Nintendo imagine the Wii to be more than just a game console, they wanted anyone to use the console for a variety of different purposes. For example, they made the Wii Balance Board so that people are able to exercise in the comfort of their own home.</p>

		<p>Nintendo also had ideas for making an avatar based system like the XBOX 360 called Miis. Miis were not as detailed as the XBOX's avatars but it added a nice cartoon look to everything to match the cartoony style of Nintendo's games.

<div class="box7">
	<h1>Nintendo 3DS</h1>
		<p>The Nintendo 3DS is the third set of handheld consoles out of the ones that were made by Nintendo throughout the years. It was released on February 2011.</p>

		<p>The two main gimmicks of the Nintendo 3DS systems is the 3DS screen which can be toggled on or off which a slider on the side of the 3DS and the gyrocope moction sensor which is when you move the 3DS around it can control things that happen in the game. For example, Super Mario 3D Land it can control the camera and in Kirby Triple Deluxe, it can move the gondolas to help Kirby move along the level.</p>

		<p>In February 2015, Nintendo released the New Nintendo 3DS and the New Nintendo 3DS XL, which was 4 years after the original 3DS was released. It has improved processing power so games can run smoother and downloads are quicker as well as giving the touch screen amiibo functionality.</p>

		<p>The 3DS has four different versions under its name which are:<p>

			<ul class="list">
				<li>Nintendo 3DS</li>
				<li>Nintendo 3DS XL</li>
				<li>New Nintendo 3DS</li>
				<li>New Nintendo 3DS XL</li>
			</ul>

<div class="box9">
	<h1>Wii U</h1>
		<p>The Wii U is the second console in the Wii series consoles and adds a new gimmick to the console with the Wii U Gamepad. It is a small tablet that allows the player to keep playing even if another person is occupying the TV using the little screen that is on the tablet. It also uses the gyroscope controls that the 3DS has as well as providing all of the controllers that the Wii used and introduced the Pro Controller, which Nintendo wanted to be used by gaming veterans.</p>

		<p>The Wii U has a terrible time whilst it was out with little 3rd party support and the underuse of the Wii U's main gimmick, the GamePad.</p>

		<p>However, the Wii U had some amazing first party titles such as Super Mario 3D World, MArio Kart 8, Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Breeze as many more. And whatever third party games they had they were good as well.</p>
